# House Price Prediction Using Neural Network

This repository contains code to train and evaluate a neural network for predicting house prices using the California housing dataset. The model is implemented using PyTorch, and the data preprocessing is done with scikit-learn.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch scikit-learn
```

## Code Overview

The main functionality is provided by the `compute` function, which trains and evaluates a neural network for regression prediction.

### `compute` Function

```python
def compute(epoch):
    """Trains and evaluates a neural network for regression prediction.

    Inputs:
        epoch (int): The number of training epochs.

    Outputs:
        result (dict): A dictionary containing the predicted house prices and the average loss.

    Requirements:
        PyTorch, scikit-learn
    """
    # Function implementation here...
```

### `test` Function

The `test` function demonstrates how to use the `compute` function:

```python
def test():
    """Test the compute function."""
    print("Running test")
    result = compute(epoch=100)
    print("Predictions:", result["predictions"])
    print("Average Loss:", result["avg_loss"])

test()
```


### Data Loading and Preprocessing

The California housing dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's `fetch_california_housing`. The data is split into training and testing sets, and features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

### Neural Network Definition

A simple feedforward neural network is defined with one hidden layer.

### Training

The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer. Training progress is printed every 10 epochs.

### Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the test set. Predictions and the average loss are returned.

## Example Output

```
Running test
Epoch [10/100], Loss: 0.5241
Epoch [20/100], Loss: 0.4312
...
Epoch [100/100], Loss: 0.2289
Average loss on test data: 0.3012
Predictions: [2.511, 3.412, 1.911, ...]
Average Loss: 0.3012
```
